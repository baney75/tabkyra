 * Free mode: the side panel runs on the best free OpenRouter model for Tabkyra's work, with

 *
 * "Best" is measured: `free-ranking.json` holds the scores from `cli/eval/free-models.mjs`
 * (real browser tasks through Tabkyra's tools). At run time the live list decides what is
 * still free and still takes tools; measured models keep their measured order, unmeasured
 * new ones follow (longest context first, then newest), and OpenRouter's own free router
 * comes last. Every model in a request is checked free against the live list, so a turn can
 * never fall through to a paid model (D25).
 *
 * Pure functions only: the side panel, the tests and the eval import this file.
