/**
 * The install gate: while the service worker swaps an update in and reloads Tabkyra, no new agent
 * run may start, so nothing runs on a mix of old and new files and no run is cut off by the
 * reload. Two parts:
 *
 * - a Web Lock, shared by the worker and every side panel (same origin). The worker holds it
 *   exclusively from its idle check through the install and the reload; a side panel starting
 *   a run takes it in shared mode, only if it is free, and marks itself busy while it holds it
 *   (reserveRun). So either the worker's idle check sees the run or the panel sees the install,
 *   and two panels never refuse each other.
 * - a fence in chrome.storage.session, written before the install or rollback is sent and kept
 *   until the reload (which clears session storage). A worker that dies mid-install lets go of
 *   the lock with its context; the fence still holds panels off, and the next worker takes the
 *   lock back from it before it lets bridge requests in (src/update/worker.ts).
