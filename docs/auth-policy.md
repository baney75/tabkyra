# Sign-in policy

Tabkyra takes **API keys**, plus exactly two subscription sign-ins: **Sign in with ChatGPT**
(OpenAI's open-source route) and **GitHub Copilot through the Copilot SDK**. Each uses the route
the provider documents for third-party apps, with Tabkyra's own registration. There is no
subscription sign-in for Anthropic or Google, because their terms forbid one.

Every subscription sign-in this fork inherited from Sitegeist worked by posing as
another product: it sent Codex CLI's, VS Code Copilot Chat's or Gemini CLI's OAuth
client id, and copied their headers. A provider can't tell that traffic from abuse of
its own app, and its terms let it suspend the account. A browser extension
must not put its users' accounts at risk to save them an API key, so those flows are gone.

The rule for any sign-in: keep a flow only when the provider explicitly permits it for
third-party apps, through a client registered to Tabkyra. Never send another app's client id,
`originator`, user agent or headers, and never spawn a provider's CLI to borrow its sign-in.

| Google | Gemini API key from Google AI Studio | Yes. The terms page lists it as a supported method. | [Gemini API key](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/api-key) | Kept. Free tier with limits, paid above it, billed by Google. |
| Anthropic | Claude Pro/Max sign-in (claude.ai OAuth, `sk-ant-oat` tokens), or spawning the user's `claude` to use its sign-in | **No, explicitly.** "Anthropic does not permit third-party developers to offer Claude.ai login into their own applications, or to route requests through Free, Pro, or Max plan credentials on behalf of their users.

## How the two subscription sign-ins work

Both run in the **native host** (`cli/src/subscriptions/`), the Node process the browser
starts for Tabkyra, never in the extension. Tokens live in owner-only files under
`~/.config/tabkyra/subscriptions/` (folder 0700, files 0600, written atomically), as OpenAI's
docs require ("Keep tokens out of browser storage"). The extension never sees a token: the host
runs a loopback proxy on `127.0.0.1` that adds the user's token to each model request. The side
panel reaches it with a random per-process secret it gets over native messaging and keeps in
memory. The proxy checks the secret and its own `Host` header, and forwards only these routes:
`GET /v1/models` and `POST /v1/responses` on `api.openai.com`, and a Copilot SDK turn.

**Sign in with ChatGPT** (`siwc.ts`):

- First sign-in: `client_id=dynamic_agent_client`, `agent_name_hint=Tabkyra`, and the host's
  `ext_agent_host_id` (`urn:uuid:...`, made once and kept). Later sign-ins reuse the issued
  `oaiapp_...` client id, with `id_token_hint` and `login_hint` while a sign-in is retained.
- The listener on `http://127.0.0.1:<port>/auth/callback` starts before the browser opens.
  Port 1455 first, any free port when it's taken; the path never changes. A fresh state, nonce
  and PKCE verifier (S256) per attempt. A callback with another state is answered and ignored.
- The code exchange goes to `auth.openai.com/api/accounts/oauth/token` with the issued client id,
  the verifier, the same redirect URI and `resource=https://api.openai.com/v1`. No secret.
- The ID token is checked against OpenAI's JWKS (from the OpenID configuration): signature,
  issuer, audience (the issued client id), expiry and nonce. A returning sign-in must be the
  same account. Plan usage needs `chatgpt.tokens.use.direct` in the granted scopes; without it
  the sign-in is kept and inference is refused with a clear choice (allow it, or use a key).
- Refresh: near expiry (5 minutes), one at a time per process and per credential file (a lock
  file, since two browsers mean two hosts). The rotating refresh token is replaced with the
  access token. A dead refresh token clears the tokens and asks for a new sign-in.
- Sign-out: revoke the refresh token at the `revocation_endpoint` (retried on network errors and
  5xx), then delete the access, refresh and ID tokens. The registration and host id stay.
- Requests: `store: false`, `stream: true`, no unsupported fields, developer instead of system
  items, function tools in a `tabkyra` namespace. The side panel shapes the body and the host
  shapes it again before forwarding (`siwcRequestBody` in `src/subscriptions/constants.ts`).
- UI per OpenAI's guidelines: "Continue with ChatGPT", a one-time "You're using your ChatGPT
  plan" note with "Got it", model names marked "(ChatGPT plan)", "Manage usage" links to
  `chatgpt.com/settings/usage`, and a usage-limit error that points there.

**GitHub Copilot** (`copilot.ts`, `copilot-turns.ts`):

- Device flow with Tabkyra's own OAuth App: `github.com/login/device/code`, then polling
  `github.com/login/oauth/access_token`. The user enters the code at `github.com/login/device`.
  No scopes are requested.
- The app issues expiring user tokens (8 hours) with a refresh token. GitHub: `client_secret` is
  "Required unless the user access token was generated using the device flow", so the refresh
  sends none. No client secret was ever generated for the app.
- Sign-out deletes the token file. Revoking the grant on GitHub's side needs the app's secret,
  so Settings points the user to `github.com/settings/applications`.
- Inference uses GitHub's Copilot SDK (`@github/copilot-sdk`, pinned to 1.0.28), installed by the
  user with `tabkyra copilot-sdk install` (about 160 MB, the SDK's runtime for the platform). The
  host creates `CopilotClient({ gitHubToken, useLoggedInUser: false, mode: "empty" })`, so it
  never falls back to another login, and one session per chat with only Tabkyra's browser tools
  (`availableTools`), `systemMessage` in append mode so GitHub's own guardrails stay, and every
  permission request denied. A tool call ends the side panel's turn; the tool's result resolves
  the SDK's waiting handler on the next turn.

## What the code does

- `src/auth/policy.ts` lists the removed providers and the subscription-only APIs
  (`openai-codex-responses`, `google-gemini-cli`). `resolveApiKey` refuses stored OAuth
  credentials and Claude subscription tokens. The stream function refuses any model on a
  removed provider or API, so a model saved before the update can't run.
- On startup, before any chat is restored, the side panel deletes tokens left by the
  removed sign-ins and says so once. A saved chat on a removed provider reopens on a
  working model.
- `scripts/build.mjs` strips pi-ai's Codex, Gemini CLI and Copilot provider code, their
  model entries, and the Claude Code identity (user agent, `x-app`, beta flag, system
  prompt) from the bundle. If upstream moves any of those files, the build fails.
- Subscription models are routed in the side panel's stream function after private mode has
  checked them: private mode refuses both, since the requests go to OpenAI or GitHub.
- The CLI's MCP server has no sign-in. It drives the browser and never calls a model.
- `test/auth-policy.test.mjs` (run by `./check.sh`) fails if any of the removed client
  ids (plain or base64), `originator`, `codex_cli_simplified_flow`, Codex's
  `auth.openai.com/oauth/` endpoints, the Copilot or Gemini CLI headers, `copilot_internal` or
  `cloudcode-pa` come back in `src/`, `static/`, `cli/src/` or `scripts/`, or in a fresh build of
  the extension. It also fails if any `auth.openai.com` or `github.com/login` URL is not one of
  the documented SIWC and device-flow endpoints, if a client secret is sent, if the subscription
  code starts a process, or if Settings offers a Claude or Google sign-in.
- `test/subscriptions-host.test.mjs` runs both sign-ins against fake OpenAI and GitHub
  endpoints: the documented parameters, PKCE, ID-token checks, 0600 files, refresh, sign-out
  (tokens deleted), and one request through each route carrying the user's token to the
  documented endpoint. `test/subscriptions-extension.test.mjs` checks that no token field or
  browser storage appears in the extension's source, the relay's guard, and request shaping.

The decision record is D26 in `docs/decisions.md`.
