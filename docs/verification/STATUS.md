# Done Criteria status

Labels: `none` (no code), `prepared` (code written, Check not run), `verified` (a Check that
could fail passed; the record is linked), `deployed`, `published`. An item is only
`verified` when its own DC Check ran. A narrower test that passed is noted under
Evidence, and the item stays `prepared`. Decisions are in [../decisions.md](../decisions.md) (D1 to D16).

Updated 2026-10-25. #13 (skills, lint, CI), #14 (library) and #15 (private mode, bug
reports) are merged to main (published). Merged code is still `prepared` against its DC
item until that item's own Check runs. Review records are in each PR's Review block.
