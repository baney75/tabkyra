# Demo video

The source for `media/demo.mp4` (1920×1080, 30 fps, H.264, silent with burned-in captions)
and `media/demo-poster.jpg` (1280×720). The shot plan is in [STORYBOARD.md](STORYBOARD.md).

Nothing on screen is mocked. `scripts/demo/capture-video.mjs` records a real run and writes
`public/capture/`:

- The built extension in a throwaway headless Chromium, its native host, and `tabkyra mcp`
  driven by a scripted MCP client that declares elicitation, the way Claude Code does. The
  browser frames are that client's own `screenshot` calls.
- The side panel is the extension's `sidepanel.html` in a tab of the same browser, clicked
  through a CDP session attached to that tab only.
- The library and skill lint beats run the real CLI against doi.org, OpenAlex and Crossref.
- `capture.json` holds the tool calls with their real results, the permission prompt, the
  copied setup prompt, and the CLI output and exit codes. Every recorded value in the video
  (call arguments, refs, results, URLs, CLI output and exit codes) is read from it. A few fixed
  labels are written in the scenes: the `# allowed beforehand: tabkyra allow 127.0.0.1` note,
  the argument-free `read_page { filter: "interactive" }` and `get_page_text {}` call lines, and
  the "Pinecrest Library" tab title.
- The video edits the order: the run did the catalog work first and opened Gutenberg after,
  but the video shows the permission beat first. Each call and result is the run's own.

## Re-record and re-render

Needs Node 22.4 or newer for the capture (it uses Node's built-in WebSocket and stops at once
on older versions), the Chromium from `cd cli && npx playwright-core install chromium`, and
network access. The render needs nothing beyond `npm install`: Remotion writes the MP4 and the
poster JPEG itself. Remotion is not open source: it is free for individuals and companies of up
to three people, and larger companies need a Remotion company license (see remotion.dev/license). A capture that fails partway leaves the previous `public/capture/` as it
was.

From the repo root:

```bash
npm run build && (cd cli && npm run build)   # the extension and CLI being filmed
node scripts/demo/capture-video.mjs          # needs network for gutenberg.org, doi.org, OpenAlex, Crossref
cd media/video && npm install
npm run render                               # out/demo.mp4 and out/demo-poster.jpg (no ffmpeg needed)
npm run publish-media                        # copies both to media/
```

`npm run dev` opens Remotion Studio for the `Demo` composition, each scene on its own, and
the `Poster` still. The side panel crops and rings are placed from element boxes the capture
records (`browser.boxes` in `capture.json`), so they follow layout changes. Live data drifts
(citation counts, the Gutenberg page), so a new capture can change a few words of output;
check the captions still match before publishing.

Fonts are Instrument Serif, Instrument Sans and JetBrains Mono under the OFL; their licenses
are in `public/fonts/`.

## Hero video

`media/hero.mp4` (1920×1080) and `media/hero-vertical.mp4` (1080×1920, the same edit for
social), both H.264 with AAC audio at 30 fps and 57.6 s, ending with the music, plus
`media/hero-poster.jpg` (1280×720). The shot plan is in [HERO-STORYBOARD.md](HERO-STORYBOARD.md);
the source is `src/hero/`, registered as the `Hero`, `HeroVertical` and `HeroPoster` compositions.

**What is recorded and what is drawn.** The browser frame is drawn; the page, the group name
and all tool output are recorded. In full: page screenshots, side panel crops, the elicitation
prompt's message and choices, the tab group name, tab titles, URLs, every tool call's arguments
and result, all CLI output and the router's matches and timing come from `public/capture/`.
Drawn are the browser frame around the page screenshots, the box around the inline prompt, the
panels that hold calls and terminal output, and the motion graphics: the helm, the stamps
(REFUSED, FLAGGED, BLOCKED), the count-ups and the type.

Every claim a stamp, highlight or label makes is checked against the recording before render:
each typed command against the recorded args (the shipped lint must have run on `skills/`),
the made-up DOI's refusal line and non-zero exit, the retraction lines and exit 3, the four lint
errors (each naming a line of the shown skill file) and non-zero exit, the shipped skills'
"✓ Clean." with no errors and exit 0, the catalog calls, found by content in recorded order, each
acting on the latest recorded `read_page`, with the `//` labels on the two clicks taken from that
snapshot's button names, the search text against the recorded results, each action's own recorded result (navigate,
type, click and fill all succeeded), the read-back sentence (the recorded `get_page_text`
result, with the book searched, the card name and the branch filled in their places), the
prompt choice the run answered (for the book's site), the tab group ("Tabkyra · claude") with the
recorded tab's title and URL, the lint summary's count against the errors listed, and the router's p95 (under 1 ms) and
each row's command (the recorded task, quoted as the capture quotes it) and routed skill, parsed from the recorded output. The checks live in `src/hero/claims.ts`, and
the scenes show what it returns. `src/hero/heroClaims.ts` runs them when Hero, HeroVertical or
HeroPoster renders, so a recording that doesn't back a claim fails those renders while the Demo
composition and Studio still load. `npm test` runs the same checks on the real capture and on
doctored copies (a doi.org outage, a failing shipped lint, an extra click before the hold, a
p95 over 1 ms, a stale confirmation, a recorded deny and more) and expects each doctored copy to
fail.

```bash
cd media/video && npm install
npm test                 # the checks above, on the real capture and on doctored copies
npm run render:hero      # out/hero.mp4, out/hero-vertical.mp4, out/hero-poster.jpg
npm run publish-hero     # copies all three to media/
```

**Music.** `public/hero/music.m4a` is an instrumental made for this video on the maintainer's
own machine (Parish1) with [ACE-Step 1.5](https://huggingface.co/ACE-Step/Ace-Step1.5) at revision
`19671f406d603126926c1b7e2adc169acbcade22`, seed 302. Its components are MIT-licensed, except
the bundled Qwen3-Embedding-0.6B text encoder, which is Apache-2.0; neither license restricts
outputs, and the model card says "You can strictly use the generated
music for **commercial purposes**." The track is distributed here under the repository's
AGPL-3.0, like every other asset. Prompt, components and their licenses, and the quote's source
are in [public/hero/NOTICE.md](public/hero/NOTICE.md). No paid or credit-based service was used.

Five takes were generated (a 30 s test and four 60 s takes) and compared by analysis rather than
by ear: tempo, beat regularity, energy per second and where the drop lands. Seed 302 was the only
take with every part the edit needs: an impact in the first second, a quieter build, 0.6 s of
near-silence (13.4–14.0 s) before the drop at 15.30 s, two drum breaks and a clean end, on a
steady 126 BPM grid. Of the others, two had no build or drop, and one ran at 99 BPM. Whisper
heard no words in it. The master was trimmed to 57.6 s with a 0.2 s fade-out, peak-limited and
set to about -14 LUFS with a true peak under -1 dBTP, then encoded as AAC.

The beat map the edit reads, `src/hero/music.json`, comes from the committed track; rerunning
this reproduces it:

```bash
ffmpeg -i public/hero/music.m4a -ac 1 -ar 22050 /tmp/hero-music.wav
python3 scripts/analyze_music.py /tmp/hero-music.wav src/hero/music.json public/hero/music.m4a   # needs librosa
```

It records the beats (126.05 BPM), downbeats, the entries where the full band comes back (15.30,
30.55 and 45.78 s; the first is the drop, +16.2 dB) and the end. Every cut and slam in
`src/hero/` is a beat index into it, so a new track only needs a new map (and the scenes
re-checked).

**The skill router.** Segment 11 (`Router` in `src/hero/Outro.tsx`) shows four real
`tabkyra skill match` runs and, from one `tabkyra skill eval --json` run, the router's p95 time
per match, the number of timed matches and the bundled skill count. The headline says "in under
a millisecond at p95": the figure is the match itself, not a whole `tabkyra` command, which also
starts Node. A caption under the rows gives the recorded wall time of each whole command. `node scripts/demo/capture-router.mjs` (after `cd cli && npm run build`) records it
into `public/capture/router.json` (stdout only; a `skill match` that writes to stderr fails it), and fails if a task routes anywhere other than its expected
skill, if the eval's gates fail, or if p95 is not under a millisecond.

## Agents video

`media/agents.mp4` (1920×1080) and `media/agents-vertical.mp4` (1080×1920), both H.264 with AAC
at 30 fps and 57.6 s, plus `media/agents-poster.jpg` (1280×720): what changed for agents
(several at once, resume, hand-off, ask_user, the side panel's `/` and `@` menus, the terminal,
reload safety). The shot plan is in [AGENTS-STORYBOARD.md](AGENTS-STORYBOARD.md); the source is
`src/agents/`, registered as `Agents`, `AgentsVertical` and `AgentsPoster`.

**The run.** `node scripts/demo/capture-agents.mjs` (after `npm run build` and `cd cli && npm run
build`) records one run into `public/capture/agents/` and `agents.json`. It needs no network: a
small shop ("Fernhill Goods") is served on 127.0.0.1 by the script, and a git repository named
`shop` stands in for the project. In a throwaway headless Chromium with the built extension:

1. Three `tabkyra mcp` processes start in `shop` with no session set, the way three Claude Code
   agents would, and each navigates to its page (product, cart, checkout). Their first calls go
   300 ms apart so agent 1 opens the first group. Group titles and colors are read from
   `chrome.tabGroups` in the browser, not from Tabkyra's records. Agent 2 then calls
   `tabs_select` on agent 1's tab and is refused.
2. Agent 1 opens a second tab, its MCP client closes (the agent quits), the group is read while
   it is gone, a new client starts in the same folder, and its `tabs_context` is recorded.
3. **The hand-off is not a mouse drag.** Headless Chromium has no tab strip, so the run calls
   `chrome.tabs.ungroup` on agent 1's second tab, which fires the same `tabs.onUpdated`
   (`groupId: -1`) event a drag out of the group does. The video draws the drag. Agent 1's next
   `tabs_context` is recorded as returned.
4. Agent 3 calls `ask_user`; the question appears in the side panel (`sidepanel.html` in a tab of
   the same browser), and the run clicks "Test card (Recommended)" and Submit there with real CDP
   mouse events. Agent 3 then fills the checkout form with that answer.
5. In the side panel composer: `/`, `writ`, Enter (the `writing` skill), `@`, `Teapot`, Enter
   (the tab the user took back), the task, Enter. The side panel's own agent runs on a **local
   model**: `qwen3-8b-nothink`, which is Ollama's `qwen3:8b` with its chat template's
   no-thinking branch always on, served by a separate Ollama on 127.0.0.1:11555 started with
   `OLLAMA_ORIGINS='chrome-extension://*' OLLAMA_CONTEXT_LENGTH=32768` (the user's own Ollama was
   not changed). No API key or paid service was used. Set `TABKYRA_DEMO_MODEL_URL` and
   `TABKYRA_DEMO_MODEL` to use another model. A model this small doesn't always finish. The run
   counts only when the chat's own record (`tabkyra threads show`, kept as `threadShown`) has a
   tool result with the page body and a last reply that states at least two facts the page body
   has and its tab title doesn't ("1 L", "$36", "infuser", "speckled", "glazed"). Otherwise, or
   when it stalls, the whole run is thrown away with its folder and starts over in a fresh
   browser and folder (up to `TABKYRA_DEMO_ATTEMPTS`, a whole number, default 3). `agents.json` records which
   attempt passed; the committed capture is attempt 2. If the model asks the user to pick an
   element, the run clicks the product description in that tab, as the user would, and records
   it (`composer.picked`); the committed run didn't ask. In the committed run the model opened
   the referenced tab's page in a new tab rather than switching to that tab, then read it with
   its REPL. That is why the caption says `@` "points it at a tab", not that it hands the tab
   over.
6. `tabkyra sessions`, `tabkyra tabs` and `tabkyra threads search teapot` run against the same
   browser, with their output and exit codes recorded (`NO_COLOR=1`).
7. Agent 3 clicks "Place order" inside an `actions` call that then waits 3 s; 800 ms in, the
   extension is reloaded. The result (`interrupted: ... Check the page`) and the shop's own order
   count (one POST) are recorded.

The capture saves nothing unless every step and check passes; a failed run leaves its
partial frames in a temp folder (copied when the repo is on another volume) and the old capture
in place.

**What is recorded and what is drawn.** Recorded: every page screenshot (each agent's own
`screenshot` call), the side panel screenshots and the boxes the crops use, group titles and
colors, tab ids, titles and URLs, every call's arguments and result text, the CLI output, and the
order count. Drawn: the address bar and tab strip around the screenshots (their text is the
recorded title and URL), the drag of the hand-off, the panels that hold call and terminal text,
the "NOT YOURS" stamp, the "agent 1 quit" and "the extension reloads" labels (each says what the
script did at that point), the count-up, and the captions.

**Checks.** `src/agents/claims.ts` checks every caption against `agents.json` before render
(`Agents`, `AgentsVertical` and `AgentsPoster` call it): three groups titled "Tabkyra · claude ·
shop", "… shop 2", "… shop 3" with distinct colors, each `tabs_context` listing only its own tab,
the refusal and agent 1's tab staying put, the restarted agent getting the same tab ids, the
hand-off news naming the tab that left with the tab now ungrouped, the answer the agent got being
the option clicked and the one it filled, the `@` menu showing the agents' tabs in use and the
teapot tab free (each agent's label matched whole, so "claude · shop" can't match the "shop 2"
row), the side panel agent going to the referenced tab's page, reading its body and stating two
of its facts in the last reply, the three commands exiting 0 and showing the three groups
(whole titles) and the chat, the hand-off happening to agent 1's group and session, and the
order running exactly once. `npm test` runs them on the real capture and on doctored copies,
which must fail. The tests import TypeScript directly, so they need Node 22.13 or newer
(`npm test` passes `--experimental-strip-types`, which Node 22.13 to 22.17 need).

```bash
cd media/video && npm install
npm test                 # hero and agents checks
npm run render:agents    # out/agents.mp4, out/agents-vertical.mp4, out/agents-poster.jpg
npm run publish-agents   # copies all three to media/
```

**Music.** The hero's track and beat map (`public/hero/music.m4a`, `src/hero/music.json`), the
same file under the same terms (see **Music** above and `public/hero/NOTICE.md`). Every cut is a
beat index into the map. The end card is the hero's.
